<h1>Ninja Turdle Coronavirus Expansion is Released!</h1>


## Hello from the Dev

I hope everyone enjoys this Ninja Turdle expansion!

While travelling to China(Shanghai) to visit with family, I found myself under forced quarantine and with limited internet.
 
I used part of that time to design out a complete new area for Ninja Turdle. 
 
I hope this fun little expansion gives people some positive energy during these tough times! ❤️
